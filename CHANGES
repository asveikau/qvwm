* Fixed: window and taskbar button naming is now based on
  WM_NAME window property primarily and WM_ICON_NAME as the
  second best.  This avoids "Untitled" name for some
  applications/windows.

* Added restart item to the default start menu
 
* Two new configuration variables for menu look preferences:
  DefaultMenuItemIcon and DefaultFolderIcon

* New configuration variable: DisableTaskbarDragging.  Should speak for
  itself.

* Window maximization is now more intuitive: if a window is maximized already,
  it is restored when you press Alt-Enter.

  (QVWM_MAXIMIZE function is now toggling the maximized state, so for an
  already maximized window it does Restore instead.  There is also new
  QVWM_MAXIMIZE_ONEWAY function for the old, unconditional behaviour.)

* Respect INIT_MAXIMIZE and INIT_MINIMIZE window options (as
  configured in .qvwmrc) on qvwm restart

* Startmenu's logo (which is usually a vertically-laid text) is now optional

* Internal: CreateImageFromFile() now does not choke on an empty string


2006-03-19  Ivan Kurmanov

* Removed useless shit lines from the taskbar (between the start button and
  the task buttons, and between the task buttons and the system tray area)

* Menu item icons are now centered in their little cells.
  For sub-menus a little folder icon is now hard-coded
  default, but there is no longer a default for non-folder
  menu items.  (Previously there was an ugly X icon default.)

* MenuItemMinimalHeight configuration variable.  Sets the default height of
  the menu items.  Default value: 18;

* Left margin fixed for menu items (it was too big)


2006-03-20  Ivan Kurmanov

* Fixed tooltip flicker, which happened sometimes at screen bottom.

* Menu drawing-padding (left margin) and positioning
  improved.  Care taken to avoid putting a menu out of the
  visible screen boundary, if possible.  Menu items' height
  now depends on the font used, but MenuItemMinimalHeight
  variable is still respected.

* Two new externally-accessible functions for window
  management: QVWM_FOCUS and QVWM_RAISE_FOCUS; via remote
  command interface they accept a window name parameter.


2006-03-21

* Reimplemented task switcher layout.  It is now vertical,
  like a menu.  

  In case, when there are lots of windows open, it will
  scroll vertically as you go through the window list.  It
  will keep the appropriate part of it visible.

  Also, system does not longer freeze while you switch
  tasks.

* Fixed a bug which stopped qvwm from reading the .qvwmrc
  file on restart, if it had found a syntax error there in
  the past.  So, even if you had corrected the rc file, you
  still were forced to quit and start it.  Not anymore.

* Added xterm to the default hard-coded start menu.  (You'll
  be able to start xterm if qvwm failed to parse its config
  file.)

* Disabling and enabling taskbar now changes maximum window
  sizes accordingly (but not immediately).


2006-03-25 released qvwm 1.1.12-6-IKu

* Fixed a little menu drawing glitch: checked mark (a tick)
  and selected mark (a bullet) were not aligned with the
  item name text.  (Would only be noticible with a
  significantly larger than default MenuItemMinimalHeight
  value.)

2006-03-28 released qvwm 1.1.12-7-IKu 

* Now will try harder to find a suitable or any at all font
  to use as the default.  (Patch comes from Kenichi Kourai.)

* Do not include <X11/xpm.h> file.  (Patch comes from
  Debian's version 1.1.12-4.)

* Made animated image support configurable at compile-time
  and disabled by default.

2006-04-01 

* New qv_deanimate utility, which is a simple tool to
  extract the first frame's image from an animated image
  file.

* Fixed a little restart bug, which caused windows with
  INIT_MAXIMIZE to be maximized over the taskbar.

* Brought the manpage man/qvwm.man up-to-date with all my
  changes.  (Only the English version.)

2006-04-01 released qvwm 1.1.12-8-IKu

2007-05-09 16:11

* Fixed a menu problem: when a menu is drawn under the
  mouse pointer, menu immediately reacted as if the
  user moved the pointer.  The menu item under the
  pointer would immediately be given focus.  (A
  submenu would be open, if there is one.)

  This is fixed now.  The mouse pointer makes a
  difference only when it was moved by the user.

* Better handling of taskbar enabling/disabling.
  Recalculate sizes of other windows and reposition them.

* fixed: segmentation fault when focus is at the root window
  (desktop?) and user tries application-window-specific
  commands like QVWM_MAXIMIZE and similar.

* Fixed a compilation error in switcher.cc (for some compiler 
  versions); thanks to Michael Sanders for reporting
