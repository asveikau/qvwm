- Bug: when a menu is open and another application creates a window and
  requires a focus, the focus granted, but the menu is not closed.  I
  guess there has to be a focus stack (and probably is) and the new
  window should probably be added at the top of the stack, but below
  the menu.

- Bug: when you disable the taskbar, you are left with the focus not given
  to any of the currently open windows.  And if you, for instance,
  tries a command like QVWM_MAXIMIZE_WINDOW, qvwm crashes.
