Qvwm window manager for X
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It is a lightweight window manager, which is built to
provide user interface which is similar to Windows 95.  It
features a start menu, a task bar, a system tray with a
clock and windows-like task-switching.  

Unlike Windows 95, qvwm's menus and almost every other
feature is controlled by a textual configuration file.  The
changes done to it in a session would not be restored unless
you write them to the conf file.


This version is based version 1.1.12-3 as provided by
Debian, with fixes and additions by Ivan Kurmanov,
http://ahinea.com/en/

See CHANGES file for a list of changes made since 1.1.12-3.
