Qvwm window manager for X
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It is a lightweight window manager, which is built to
provide user interface which is similar to Windows 95.  It
features a start menu, a task bar, a system tray with a
clock and windows-like task-switching.  

Unlike Windows 95, qvwm's menus and almost every other
feature is controlled by a textual configuration file.  The
changes done to it in a session would not be restored unless
you write them to the conf file.

Maintenance history:

This version comes from: https://github.com/asveikau/qvwm
Patches since prior versions focus on (1) building on modern
systems and (2) scaling the pixmaps if you increase the size
of frame borders.

The initial commit to github was based on version 1.1.12-3
as provided by Debian, with fixes and additions by
